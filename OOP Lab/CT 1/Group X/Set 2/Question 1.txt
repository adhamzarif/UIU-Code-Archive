```Your IT firm has been given the task of designing 
 a LMS application. It contains many modules ,but you have 
been assigned to one module: Designing the StudentGrades class.
The Specifications for the StudentGrades class are as follows:
1.There is 1 attribute: an array named grades that contains the grades of student
as doubles. The minimum 
value is 0 the maximum can be 100. This attribute is private and needs a getter.
2. You are to design a constructor that takes in a double array as a parameter and initializes the grades
attribute.

3. You need to create 4 methods: 8
a. double averageGrade(): A method that calculates and returns the average of the grades in the
array as a double.
b. double maxGrade(): A method that finds and returns the maximum grade in the array as a

 double.
c. double minGrade(): A method that finds and returns the minimum grade in the array as a double.

= d. void fixGrades(): A method that checks all the grades in the array. If the grade is below 0. it

makes the grade at that position 0.
e. void displayGrades(: A method that prints all the grades in the array, but not as doubles. For the

following range, it prints the grade letters instead:
i. If the range is within 0-49, print F

i. If the range is within 50-69, print D

iii. If the range is within 70-79, print Cc
iv. If the range is within 80-89, print B

v. If the range is within 90-100, print A

Create objects for this case and test out each method.```
