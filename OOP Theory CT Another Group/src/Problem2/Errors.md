### 1. **Interface Method Declaration Error**
- The method `replace Engine()` in the `Engine` interface has a space between `replace` and `Engine`.
- **Correction**: The method should be declared as `replaceEngine()` without the space.

### 2. **Class Naming Error**
- The class name `Vehicle Test` has a space between `Vehicle` and `Test`.
- **Correction**: The class name should be `VehicleTest` (no space).

### 3. **Object Instantiation Error**
- The statement `Vehicle v2 = new Electric Vehicle();` has a space between `Electric` and `Vehicle`.
- **Correction**: It should be `Vehicle v2 = new ElectricVehicle();` without the space.

### 4. **Class Inheritance and Interface Implementation Conflict**
- In the declaration `class Electric Vehicle implements Engine extends Vehicle`, you cannot use both `implements` and `extends` together on the same line like that.
- **Correction**: The correct order should be `class ElectricVehicle extends Vehicle implements Engine` (extends first, then implements).

### 5. **Missing Method Parameter and Body in `getSpeed`**
- In the `Vehicle` class, the method `getSpeed(String engineType)` is incorrectly declared without a body, and it lacks the `abstract` keyword.
- **Correction**: Either implement the method fully or mark it as `abstract`. Also, the `getSpeed` method in `ElectricVehicle` does not accept any parameters, causing a method signature mismatch.

### Summary of Fixes:
- **Spaces in Method Names**: Removed spaces (e.g., `replace Engine()` → `replaceEngine()`).
- **Class Naming**: Removed spaces in class names (e.g., `Vehicle Test` → `VehicleTest`).
- **Object Instantiation**: Fixed instantiation issues (`new Electric Vehicle()` → `new ElectricVehicle()`).
- **Inheritance and Implementation**: Corrected the order of `extends` and `implements`.
- **Method Signature Matching**: Fixed the mismatch in `getSpeed()` method signature.
