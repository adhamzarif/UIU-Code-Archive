Your IT firm has been given the task of designing a smart home system.It contains many modules,but you 
have been assigned to one module:designing the temperatureControler class

The specifications for the TemperatureController class are as follows: ;
1. There is 1 attribute: an array named temperatures that contains the temperatures of the rooms in the
form of integers. The minimum value is 25, the maximum can be 40. This attribute is private and needs.
a getter and setter.
2. You are to design a constructor that takes in a double array as a parameter and initializes the
temperatures attribute.
3. You need to create 4 methods:

double averageTemperature(): A method that calculates and returns the average of the
temperatures in the array as a double.

void findNormalTempRooms(): A method that prints the index positions of the array where the
temperature is between 27-30.

int maxTemperature(): A method that finds and returns the maximum temperature in the array.
int minTemperature(): A method that finds and returns the minimum temperature in the array.
int countAboveThreshold(int threshold): A method that counts and returns the number of
temperatures above a given threshold as an int.

Create obiects for this case and test out each method.
