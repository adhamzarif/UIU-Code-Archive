```java
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
```
- **Declaration of the Method:** This line declares the `actionPerformed` method, which is part of the `ActionListener` interface. It takes an `ActionEvent` object `e` as an argument, representing the event that occurred (e.g., a button click).

```java
    if (e.getSource() == Perform) {
```
- **Check Button Source:** This line checks if the source of the event (`e.getSource()`) is the `Perform` button. If true, the subsequent code will execute, indicating that the user clicked the "Perform" button.

```java
        char operator = ' ';
```
- **Initialize Operator:** This line initializes a `char` variable `operator` to a space character. It will later hold the arithmetic operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`) extracted from the input.

```java
        int inputNumber = 0;
```
- **Initialize Input Number:** This line initializes an `int` variable `inputNumber` to 0. It will store the numeric value entered after the operator in the input field.

```java
        int i = 0;
```
- **Initialize Index Variable:** This line initializes an `int` variable `i` to 0. It will be used as an index to iterate through the characters of the input string.

```java
        String inputText = Input.getText();
```
- **Get Input Text:** This line retrieves the text from the `Input` `JTextField` and stores it in the `inputText` variable for further processing.

```java
        while (i < inputText.length()) {
```
- **Loop Start:** This line begins a `while` loop that will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `inputText`, ensuring that we don't go out of bounds when accessing characters.

```java
            char ch = inputText.charAt(i);
```
- **Get Character at Index:** This line retrieves the character at the current index `i` from `inputText` and stores it in the `char` variable `ch`.

```java
            if (ch == '+' || ch == '-' || ch == '*' || ch == '/') {
```
- **Check for Operator:** This line checks if `ch` is one of the valid arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).

```java
                operator = ch;
```
- **Store the Operator:** If the condition in the previous line is true, this line assigns the found operator `ch` to the `operator` variable.

```java
                i++;
```
- **Increment Index:** This line increments `i` to move to the next character in the input string. This increment occurs even if the operator is found but is not strictly necessary because the loop will continue.

```java
                break;
```
- **Exit Loop:** This line exits the `while` loop immediately after finding the operator, as there's no need to continue searching.

```java
            }
            i++;
```
- **Increment Index (if not operator):** This line increments `i` to check the next character if the current character is not an operator.

```java
        }
```
- **End of Loop:** This marks the end of the `while` loop.

```java
        while (i < inputText.length() && Character.isWhitespace(inputText.charAt(i))) {
```
- **Skip Whitespace:** This line begins a `while` loop that will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `inputText` and the current character is a whitespace. It is used to skip any spaces after the operator.

```java
            i++; // Skip whitespace
```
- **Increment Index:** This line increments `i` to move to the next character, effectively skipping any whitespace characters.

```java
        }
```
- **End of Loop:** This marks the end of the whitespace-skipping loop.

```java
        while (i < inputText.length() && Character.isDigit(inputText.charAt(i))) {
```
- **Parse the Number:** This line begins another `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `inputText` and the current character is a digit. It is used to parse the numeric value following the operator.

```java
            inputNumber = inputNumber * 10 + (inputText.charAt(i) - '0');
```
- **Construct Number:** This line updates `inputNumber` by multiplying its current value by 10 (to shift the previous digits left) and adding the integer value of the current digit (`inputText.charAt(i) - '0'` converts the character to its integer equivalent).

```java
            i++;
```
- **Increment Index:** This line increments `i` to move to the next character in the input string.

```java
        }
```
- **End of Loop:** This marks the end of the number-parsing loop.

```java
        // Check if operator was found
```
- **Comment:** This comment indicates that the next block of code will check if a valid operator was found.

```java
        if (operator == ' ') {
```
- **Check for Valid Operator:** This line checks if the `operator` variable is still a space character, indicating that no valid operator was found in the input.

```java
            System.out.println("Please enter a valid operator followed by a number.");
```
- **Error Message:** If no operator was found, this line prints an error message to the console, instructing the user to enter a valid input.

```java
            return;
```
- **Exit Method:** This line exits the `actionPerformed` method, stopping further execution since the input was invalid.

```java
        }
```
- **End of If Statement:** This marks the end of the conditional check for the operator.

```java
        switch (operator) {
```
- **Switch Statement:** This line starts a `switch` statement that will execute different cases depending on the value of `operator`.

```java
            case '+':
                outputValue += inputNumber;
                break;
```
- **Addition Case:** If the operator is `+`, this code adds `inputNumber` to `outputValue`. The `break` statement exits the switch.

```java
            case '-':
                outputValue -= inputNumber;
                break;
```
- **Subtraction Case:** If the operator is `-`, this code subtracts `inputNumber` from `outputValue`.

```java
            case '*':
                outputValue *= inputNumber;
                break;
```
- **Multiplication Case:** If the operator is `*`, this code multiplies `outputValue` by `inputNumber`.

```java
            case '/':
```
- **Division Case:** If the operator is `/`, the following block checks if the division can proceed.

```java
                if (inputNumber != 0) {
```
- **Check for Division by Zero:** This line checks if `inputNumber` is not zero to prevent division by zero.

```java
                    outputValue /= inputNumber;
```
- **Perform Division:** If `inputNumber` is not zero, this line divides `outputValue` by `inputNumber`.

```java
                } else {
```
- **Else Block:** This begins the else block for handling division by zero.

```java
                    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
```
- **Error Message for Division by Zero:** If `inputNumber` is zero, this line prints an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

```java
                    return;
```
- **Exit Method:** This line exits the `actionPerformed` method, stopping further execution due to the error.

```java
                }
                break;
```
- **End of Division Case:** This closes the division case and the switch statement.

```java
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid operator. Please use +, -, * or /.");
                return;
```
- **Default Case:** If `operator` is not one of the recognized operators, this code prints an error message indicating that the operator is invalid and exits the method.

```java
        }
```
- **End of Switch Statement:** This marks the end of the switch statement.

```java
        Output.setText(String.valueOf(outputValue));
```
- **Update Output Label:** This line converts `outputValue` to a string and sets it as the text of the `Output` label, displaying the result of the operation to the user.

### Summary
The `actionPerformed` method processes user input from a GUI text field, performs the specified arithmetic operation based on an operator, handles potential errors, and updates the display accordingly. It includes various checks to ensure the input is valid and to prevent runtime errors like division by zero.
